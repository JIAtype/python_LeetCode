分割线-这里开始语法

使用Tab来给代码分优先级

单行注释：
#This is a comment

多行注释：
"""

written in
more than just one line
"""

Variable Names：
1.（Abc, _）must start with a letter or the underscore character,cannot start with a number
2. only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
3. case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
4. cannot be any of the Python keywords.

Camel Case:
myVariableName = "John"

Pascal Case:
MyVariableName = "John"

Creating Variables：
x = 5   # x is of type int
y = "John"  # y is now of type string
y = 'John'  # y is now of type string

print(type(x)) #输出：<class 'int'>

Casting:
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0

Case-Sensitive：
a = 4
A = "Sally"
#A will not overwrite a

Many Values to Multiple Variables:
x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"

One Value to Multiple Variables:
x = y = z = "Orange"

Unpack a Collection:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] #单引号是一样的
x, y, z = fruits

以下三种输出，都输出：Python is awesome

print("Python is awesome") 

x = "Python"
y = "is"
z = "awesome"
print(x, y, z)

x = "Python "
y = "is "
z = "awesome"
print(x + y + z) #如果都是int，会输出和
