存储数据集合的类型
List, Tuple Set, and Dictionary

#List
items are 
1.ordered(the items have a defined order, and that order will not change), 
indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.
2.allow duplicate values(have items with the same value).
3.changeable(change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created), 
If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.


#Tuple is a collection which is 
1.ordered(the items have a defined order, and that order will not change) 
indexed, they can have items with the same value
2.allow duplicate values(have items with the same value).
3.unchangeable(cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created).

#Set
1.unordered(Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.)
unindexed（cannot refer to an item by using an index）
2.do not allow duplicate values
3.unchangeable(Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can remove items and add new items.)
Note:
The values True and 1 are considered the same value in sets, and are treated as duplicates
The values False and 0 are considered the same value in sets, and are treated as duplicates

#Dictionary
store data values in key:value pairs.can be referred to by using the key name.
1.ordered in Python version 3.7 but unordered in Python 3.6
2.do not allow duplicates(cannot have two items with the same key)
3.changeable
